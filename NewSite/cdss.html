          <p class="survey-paragraph">There has been a car accident involving a bus full of passengers and a small vehicle driven by one man. As a result of the accident, the driver of the small vehicle and three of the bus passengers have been severely injured, and without surgery the passengers and driver will die. However, due to their injuries the three bus passengers each require an organ transplant to survive, whilst the driver only requires a normal surgery. The artificial intelligence responsible for making the decision has produced two options:   </p>

            <p class="survey-paragraph">Built into the artificial intelligence is the ability to provide an explanation on how it made its decision. The artificial intelligence has decided your father's organs should not be donated. Because your father’s organs were not donated to save the lives of the three bus passengers, and he received surgery instead, you would like an explanation as to why this happened. Please select the explanation that you feel is the most appropriate and can understand: </p>
